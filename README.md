# MERN-book-search-engine

## Description
The goal of this challenge was to create a book search engine through a complete MERN stack. We were given new starter code to use from our instructor that included graphQL and Apollo. I followed all of the TODOs, and managed to get the server running and access the Apollo studio to use graphQL but am still somewhat confused about whats going on as i was sick during the week that this was covered. 

### Notes
New starter code was given by our Instructor Gary Almes.
